### Project Description:
Although the US started vaccination last December, only 66% of the total population have received at least one dose of covid-19 vaccine. Reaching a high vaccination rate is the key to eliminates the virus from the country.  This project focuses on the current topic of COVID-19 vaccinations. In this project, we studied the vaccination status of the US counties about who is receiving the vaccine and racial, economical, demographic, and political disparities in the vaccination. 
For data, we used vaccine dataset from Center of Disease Control(CDC), Kaggle and from other different sources. Demographics and other parameters like income, poverty, population, unemployment rate, we used from Census API.  2020 election data  is from MIT data source to see the gap in vaccination rates between counties that voted for Biden to Trump. 

The data transformation process was performed using Jupyter Notebook, and data was loaded into a PostgreSQLby using sqlalchemy  and pymongo database for preparing the data for further analysis. 
Hence from this project, we get all the data to find relationship between income, race, demographic, and politics of US counties to covid-19 vaccination.
